## Project Insight
CNG cars offer higher mileage compared to other fuel types, Additionally, they have the lowest average service cost, indicating lower maintenance expenses. This makes CNG vehicles a cost-effective option for budget-conscious consumers seeking both fuel efficiency and affordability.
Diesel cars tend to have the highest service costs while delivering the lowest mileage among all fuel types this suggest that diesel vehicles may be less cost-effective in the long run due to higher maintenance expenses and lower fuel efficiency.
Both manual and automatic cars have similar average service costs, indicating that transmission type does not significantly impact maintenance expenses. 
Mahindra stands out as the most expensive automobile brand, with an average selling price of 2.0 million from 2016 to 2024, followed closely by Honda at 1.97 million. In contrast, Kia ranks the lowest among the eight brands, with an average price of 1.92 million. This suggests that Mahindra commands a premium, possibly due to its focus on SUVs and high-end models, while Honda also maintains a strong market presence with slightly lower pricing.
Cars with 6- and 7-seater capacities recorded higher sales compared to 4- and 5-seater vehicles. This trend suggests a growing consumer preference for larger vehicles, likely driven by factors such as family needs, group travel convenience, and the rising popularity of SUVs and MPVs. The demand for spacious cars may also reflect market trends favoring versatility and comfort over compact models.
The best-selling car models for each brand reflect consumer preferences across various manufacturers. These include Honda - Amaze, Hyundai - i10, Kia - Sonet, Mahindra - Scorpio, Maruti Suzuki - Dzire, Renault - Duster, Skoda - Kushaq, Tata Motors - Tiago, Toyota - Fortuner, and Volkswagen - Taigun. Among these, the Honda Amaze emerges as the top-selling model overall.



## Conclusion:
The analysis reveals key trends in the Indian automobile market. CNG cars offer the best fuel efficiency with the lowest service costs, making them a cost-effective choice, while diesel cars have the highest service costs and lowest mileage. Manual and automatic cars have similar maintenance costs, but automatics provide better fuel efficiency.
Among brands, Mahindra leads in average price, followed by Honda and Kia, highlighting Mahindraâ€™s premium positioning. Larger vehicles (6-7 seaters) outsell smaller ones, indicating a shift towards SUVs and MPVs. The Honda Amaze stands out as the highest-selling model, reinforcing strong consumer preference for compact sedans.
These insights provide valuable guidance for market strategies, pricing models, and consumer preference analysis in the Indian automotive industry.
